# microcontroller
# Arduino and other microcontroller based code examples. 
# all sketch files are expected to have guides commented into them. need more info, just ask. im going to start including physical pictures and  schematics of built projects into the scetch folder if it doesnt interfere with loading the files. 
# not all of these sketches use a standard arduino. and comments in the files will show that. 
# some boards used, Arduino Uno, Adafruit metro/metro mini, Adafruit trinket/trinketPro (know their limitations), Adafruit circuit playground...
# if there are no comments about arduino or microcontroler specifics, then you can assume the base is done on a UNO Arduino board, you may need to adjust for your particular microcontroller.
